Plot
The Kim family—father Ki-taek, mother Chung-sook, daughter Ki-jeong and son Ki-woo—live in a small semi-basement apartment (banjiha)[10], have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to make ends meet. One day Min-hyuk, a friend of Ki-woo's and a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to promise wealth to whoever possesses it. He suggests that, when he leaves to study abroad, Ki-woo should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye. Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park decides to call him Kevin.

Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the home of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as "Jessica", an art therapist, who agrees to counsel the Parks' restless young son, Da-song. Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur for having sex in the car, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the long-time housekeeper's severe peach allergy and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis.

When the Parks leave home to go on a camping trip, the Kim family revels in the luxuries of the mansion. Unexpectedly, Moon-gwang, the former housekeeper, returns. She reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the architect and previous owner of the mansion. Over four years ago, before the Parks moved in, Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, began secretly living underneath the home to hide from loan sharks. After realizing the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers.

Because of a rainstorm, the Parks return home early from their camping trip, and the Kim family scrambles to clean up the home, while a brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kim family trap Geun-sae and a fatally wounded Moon-gwang—she was kicked down a flight of stairs by Chung-sook—in the bunker. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park reveals to her that Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he witnessed a "ghost"—Geun-sae—emerging from the basement. As the remaining Kims hide nearby, Mr. Park complains to his wife about Ki-taek's smell.

Escaping from the Parks' house, the Kims return to their apartment and find it completely flooded due to the storm, and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to attend as employees. In the middle of the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. While Ki-taek attempts to help Ki-jeong, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction towards Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.

Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, while it is revealed that Ki-jeong has died from her injury and Ki-taek, who is wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae’s motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo continues to scope out the Parks' home, which has now been sold to a German family, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo writes a letter to his father, vowing that he will one day earn enough money to purchase the house, free his father, and reunite as a family.

Production
Development
The idea for Parasite originated in 2013. While working on Snowpiercer, Bong was encouraged by a theatre actor friend to write a play. He had been a tutor for the son of a wealthy family in Seoul in his early 20s, and considered turning his experience into a stage production.[12] After completing Snowpiercer, Bong wrote a 15-page film treatment for the first half of Parasite, which his production assistant on Snowpiercer, Han Jin-won, turned into three different drafts of the screenplay.[12] After finishing Okja, Bong returned to the project and finished the script; Han received credit as a co-writer.[12]

Bong has acknowledged that the film was influenced by the 1960 Korean "domestic Gothic" film The Housemaid, in which a middle-class family's stability is threatened by the arrival of a disruptive interloper in the form of household help.[13] The incident of Christine and Léa Papin—two live-in maids who murdered their employers in 1930s France—also served as a source of inspiration to Bong.[14]

The film's title "Parasite" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said "Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites."[15]

Darcy Paquet, an American residing in Korea, served as translator for the English subtitles and worked directly with Bong.[16] Paquet rendered Jjapaguri or Chapaguri (짜파구리), a dish cooked by a character in the film, as ram-don, meaning ramen-udon. It is a mix of Chapagetti and Neoguri.[17] The English version of the film shows packages labelled in English "ramyeon" and "udon" to highlight to English speakers how the name was created. Paquet believed the word ram-don did not previously exist as he found no results on Google.[18] On one occasion, Paquet used Oxford University as a reference instead of Seoul National University, and in another, used WhatsApp as the messaging application instead of KakaoTalk.[16] Paquet chose Oxford over Harvard University because of Bong's affinity for the United Kingdom, and because Paquet believed using Harvard would be "too obvious a choice."[18] Paquet wrote, "[I]n order for humor to work, people need to understand it immediately. With an unfamiliar word, the humor is lost."[18]

Filming
Principal photography for Parasite began on 18 May 2018[19][20] and ended 77 days later on 19 September 2018.[21] Filming took place around Seoul and in Jeonju.[22]

The Parks' house, said in the film to be designed by a fictional architect named Namgoong Hyeonja, was an entirely newly-built set.[23] Production designer Lee Ha-jun said the sun was an important factor with building the outdoor set. "The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots," explained Lee. "We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from tungsten light sources. Before building the set, the DP and I visited the lot several times to check the sun's movement at each time, and we decided on the set's location together."[24]

"Since Mr. Park's house is built by an architect in the story, it wasn't easy finding the right approach to designing the house," he added. "I'm not an architect, and I think there's a difference in how an architect envisions a space and how a production designer does. We prioritize blocking and camera angles while architects build spaces for people to actually live in and thus design around people. So I think the approach is very different."[24]

According to editor Jinmo Yang, Bong Joon-Ho chose to shoot the film without traditional coverage. To give them more editing options with limited shots, they sometimes stitched together different takes of the same shot.[25]

Themes and interpretations
The main themes of Parasite are class conflict and social inequality.[26][27] Film critics and Bong Joon-ho himself have considered the film as a reflection of modern capitalism,[28][29] and some have associated it with the term "Hell Joseon", a phrase which has become popular, especially with young people, in the late 2010s to describe the difficulties of life in South Korea.[30][31] The film also analyses the use of "connections" to get ahead, especially for rich families[32] but also for the poor Kims as well.

Bong has referred to Parasite as an upstairs/downstairs or "stairway movie",[14] in which staircases are used as a motif to represent the positions of the Kim and Park families as well as those of Moon-gwang.[33] The semi-basement apartment that the Kims live in are common for poorer Seoul residents due to their low rent prices, despite having several issues such as increased mold and risk of disease.[26] Monsoon floods such as the one depicted in the film increasingly damage these types of residences the most.[32] Some critics see references to the unjust consequences of climate change.[34]

According to Bong, the ending implies that Ki-woo will not be able to earn the funds needed to buy the house as it shows Ki-woo still in the basement; he described this shot as a "surefire kill" (확인사살), referring to a coup de grace to ensure death.[14] The ending song refers to Ki-woo working to get money to make the house; Choi Woo-shik stated that "I'm pretty sure Ki-woo is one of those bright kids. He'll come up with some idea, and he would just go into the German family's house, and I think he will rescue his father."[35]

The Park family's young son, Da-song, is obsessed with "Indians" and owns Native American themed toys and decorations.[36] According to Bong, they are inauthentic replicas, as "the mom [talks] about how she purchased things on American sites. And so basically, she purchased all these Native American goods from Amazon."[37] Bong has noted that "the Native Americans have a very complicated and long, deep history. But in this family, that story is reduced to a young boy’s hobby and decoration," likening it to wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt without knowing about the revolutionary's life. "That’s what happens in our current time: The context and meaning behind these actual things only exists as a surface-level thing."[38]

Club's A. A. Dowd gave the film an A−, praising the fun and surprising twists.[71] Joshua Rivera from GQ gave a glowing review and declared Parasite to be "Maybe 2019's best film", further adding, "It's so top-to-bottom satisfying that even being completely spoiled couldn't ruin it – but if you can come to it cold, you'll be floored."[72] Parasite also ranked 1st in a survey conducted by IndieWire of over 300 critics, in the Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Foreign Film categories.[73]

Main article: List of accolades received by Parasite
Parasite won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first South Korean film to do so, as well as the first film to win with a unanimous vote since Blue Is the Warmest Colour at the Festival in 2013.[78][79] At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for three awards including Best Director and Best Screenplay, and won Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first ever Korean film to achieve that feat.[80][81]

It was selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, making the December shortlist.[82][83][84] It went on to win four awards: Best Picture, Best Director, International Feature Film and Original Screenplay. It was the first non-English language film in Oscar history to win the award for Best Picture. Bong Joon-ho won all four categories for which he was nominated, tying the record for most wins in a single night with Walt Disney, who set the record in 1953.[note 2][86] Bong became the first person to win four awards for a single film in Academy Award history.[87] Parasite is the first South Korean-made film to be nominated for the Best Picture award at the Academy Awards, and the second East Asian film to receive a Best Picture nomination after Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.[88] It also received nominations for Best Production Design and Best Film Editing.[89][90]

Parasite became the second international film to ever be nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture since the film Life Is Beautiful (1997) , and ultimately won the category, making history as the first ever international film to win the prize.[citation needed] It was nominated for four awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Not in the English Language. It is the first Korean film to receive nominations at the British Academy Film Awards (except for Best Film Not in the English Language).

Notes
 Although Parasite was the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture at the Oscars, it is not to be confused with the first foreign film (produced by a company of a country that does not have English as its primary language) to win Best Picture, which was achieved by The Artist in 2012. The French-produced film was largely silent with French intertitles and contained a few spoken lines in English.[8] The Academy dictates foreign language as the main qualification for international film, hence The Artist did not qualify.[9]
 This achievement was made possible by a change to the rules regarding Best International Feature (formerly known as Best Foreign Language Film) in 2014. Previously, awards in this category were presented to the country of the film and accepted by the director on behalf of the country. Only the name of the country was etched onto the statuette. Since the 86th ceremony, the director's name is also on the statuette, and the director may keep it
